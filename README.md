# Deno | The Planets Project

A starting point for using **Deno File IO**

- **Kepler** spacecraft (March 6, 2009) watches a patch of space for indications of Earth-sized planets orbiting stars similar to the sun. Using special detectors similar to those used in digital cameras, Kepler looks for a slight dimming in the stars as planets pass between the stars and Kepler. The observatory's place in space allows it to watch the same stars constantly throughout its mission, something observatories such as NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes cannot do.
